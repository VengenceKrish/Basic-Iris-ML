This is a very simple ML program that uses linear regression to classify iris flowers based on sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, and petal_width. 
By entering those values, the code will return the species a flower with those specifications belongs to. The program makes use of the iris dataset, which is linked in the code and read using pandas.
